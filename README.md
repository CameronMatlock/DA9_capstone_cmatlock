# DA9 Capstone Project

For this project, I will be analyzing how cost of living and overall affordability differentiates from states in which people are moving away from versus states that people are moving to.

The time frame and scope for this analysis will be between 2020-2022 in the 50 states.


Questions to be answered are:
 - Do states that have a higher cost of living index experience a higher rate of people moving out of the state?
 - Likewise, do states with a lower cost of living index increase in population?
 - Does the median price of housing by state have any affect on the population change?
 - What states dont follow the trends of others if any? Are there any reason in particular?
