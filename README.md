# Does the Cost Really Matter?

For this project, I will be analyzing how cost of living and overall affordability differentiates from states in which people are moving away from versus states that people are moving to.


## Personal Motivation

I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California until the age of 15 before moving to Nashville, Tennessee. As someone who had zero financial responsibility at the time, the move that my parents chose to do confused me. All of our extended family lived in Southern California with it also being the place my parents had lived for their entire lives, so it really didnt make too much sense for me at the time. But I came to find out that with my dads ability to work remote we were able to live a much more affordable and comfortable life elsewhere. This inspired me to see if this was a common occurrence for people besides just my family, leading me to making this analysis.


## Information and Questions to be answered

The time frame and scope for this analysis will be between 2020-2022 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.


Questions to be answered are:
 - Do states that have a higher cost of living index experience a higher rate of people moving out of the state?
 - Likewise, do states with a lower cost of living index increase in population?
 - Does the median price of housing by state have any affect on the population change?
 - What states dont follow the trends of others if any? Are there any reason in particular?


## Datasets Used

[Redfin Public Housing Data](https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/)

[Census Bureau State Population Data](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-state-total.html)

[World Population Review Cost of Living Index Data](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/cost-of-living-index-by-state)


## Technologies Used

Python - Jupyter Notebook

Tableau

Microsoft Excel

Microsoft PowerPoint


## Known Issues

This analysis main scope is looking at the population change from state to state and how it is affected by the Cost of Living Index and housing data. 

This means that other factors that may contribute to people migrating between states; such as crime, weather, political stance and religious ideology are not a factor with the analysis.

There are many reason individuals decide to move from one state to another, but with this analysis we will just be focusing on the cost and affordability at the state level.


## Conclusions

From this analysis, we can determain that there is a fairly established trend between how expensive a state is to live in and the population changing because of it.

For the most part, states that are more expensive than average to live it, tend to see a greater population decline than the rest.

Vise versa, states that are typically more affordable to live in, seem to overall increase in population compared to the rest. 

However, there are still multiple outliers that to not follow this trend, henceforth we can not make the conclusion that this is an actual fact. 

With so many factors involved in a persons choice to move between states, Cost of living and overall affordability is a decent metric to go off of, but not perfect when trying to predict and determain why states grow and shrink in population.


## Acknowledgements

This would have never been a possible project I could have done without the time I spent at the Nashville Software School. 

I want to give a huge thanks to my instructors: Dibran Rexhepi, Olariche "Ola" Obe, Alex Wright and Sobiya Uddin.

I also want to thank all my fellow classmates in the DA9 Cohort. All the various group projects and analysis that we did together truely pushed me foward to this point.

The past 6 months were a great time, and will surely make a huge impact with me for the rest of my life.
